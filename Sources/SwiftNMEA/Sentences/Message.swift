         8.3.3 ABK – AIS addressed and binary broadcast acknowledgement

         The `ABK`-sentence is generated when a transaction, initiated by reception
         of an `ABM`, `AIR`, or `BBM` sentence, is completed or terminated. This
         sentence provides information about the success or failure of a requested
         `ABM` broadcast of either ITU-R M.1371 Messages 6 or 12. The `ABK` process
         utilises the information received in ITU-R M.1371 Messages 7 and 13. Upon
         reception of either a VHF Data-link Message 7 or 13, or the failure of
         Messages 6 or 12, the AIS unit delivers the ABK sentence to the external
         application. This sentence is also used to report to the external
         application the AIS unit’s handling of the `AIR` (ITU-R M.1371 Message 15)
         and `BBM` (ITU-R M.1371 Messages 8, 14, 19, and 21) sentences. The external
         application initiates an interrogation through the use of the
         `AIR`-sentence, or a broadcast through the use of the `BBM` sentence. The
         AIS unit generates an ABK sentence to report the outcome of the `ABM`,
         `AIR`, or `BBM` broadcast process.

         The `ABK` is also used as an input and output to indicate that a received
         Message 12 has been read and acknowledged on a display unit.

         - Parameter MMSI: Identifies the distant addressed AIS unit involved with
         the acknowledgement. If more than one MMSI is being addressed
         (ITU-R M.1371 Messages 15 and 16), the MMSI of the first distant AIS
         unit, identified in the message, is the MMSI reported here. This is a
         `nil` field when the ITU-R M.1371 Message type is 8 or 14.
         - Parameter channel: Indication of the VHF data link channel upon which a
         Message type 7 or 13 acknowledgement was received. An “A” indicates
         reception on channel A. A “B” indicates reception on channel B.
         - Parameter messageID: This indicates to the external application the type
         of ITU-R M.1371 message that this `ABK` sentence is addressing.
         - Parameter sequence: The message sequence number, together with the
         message ID and MMSI of the addressed AIS unit, uniquely identifies a
         previously received `ABM`, `AIR`, or `BBM` sentence. Generation of an
         `ABK` sentence makes a sequence message identifier available for re-use.
         The message ID determines the source of the message sequence number.

         This sentence supports ITU-R M.1371 Messages 6 and 12 and provides an
         external application with a means to exchange data via an AIS transponder.
         Data is defined by the application only, not the AIS unit. This message
         offers great flexibility for implementing system functions that use the
         transponder like a communications device. After receiving this sentence
         via the IEC 61162-2 interface, the transponder initiates a VDL broadcast of
         either Message 6 or 12. The AIS unit will make up to four broadcasts of the
         message. The actual number will depend on the reception of an
         acknowledgement from the addressed “destination” AIS unit. The success or
         failure of reception of this transmission by the addressed AIS unit is
         confirmed through the use of the “Addressed binary and safety related
         message acknowledgement” `ABK` sentence formatter, and the processes that
         support the generation of an `ABK` sentence.

         - Parameter sequentialIdentifier: This sequential message identifier serves
         two purposes. It meets the requirements as stated in 7.2.5 and it is the
         sequence number utilised by ITU-R M.1371 in Message types 6 and 12. The
         range of this field is restricted by ITU-R M.1371 to 0 – 3. The
         sequential message identifier value may be re-used after the AIS unit
         provides the `ABK` acknowledgement for this number.
         - Parameter MMSI: The MMSI of the destination AIS unit for the ITU-R M.1371
         Message 6 or 12.
         - Parameter channel: AIS channel for broadcast of the radio message.
         - Parameter messageID: ITU-R M.1371 Message ID (``AIS/MessageID/addressedBinary`` or ``AIS/MessageID/addressedSafety``).
         - Parameter data: This is the content of the “binary data” parameter for
         ITU-R M.1371 Messages 6, or the “Safety related Text” parameter for
         Message 12. Up to 936 bits of binary data (156 six-bit coded characters)

         8.3.5 ACA – AIS channel assignment message

         An AIS device can receive regional channel management information in four
         ways: ITU-R M.1371 Message 22, DSC telecommand received on channel 70,
         manual operator input, and an `ACA` sentence. The AIS unit may store
         channel management information for future use. Channel management
         information is applied based upon the actual location of the AIS device.
         An AIS unit is “using” channel management information when the information
         is being used to manage the operation of the VHF receiver and/or
         transmitter inside the AIS unit.

         This sentence is used both to enter and obtain channel management
         information. When sent to an AIS unit, the `ACA` sentence provides regional
         information that the unit stores and uses to manage the internal VHF radio.
         When sent from an AIS unit, the `ACA` sentence provides the current channel
         management information retained by the AIS unit. The information contained
         in this sentence is similar to the information contained in an ITU-R M.1371
         Message 22. The information contained in this sentence directly relates to
         the initialisation phase and dual channel operation and channel management
         functions of the AIS unit as described in ITU-R M.1371.

         - Parameter sequenceNumber: This is used to bind the contents of the `ACA`
         and `ACS` sentences together. The `ACS` sentence, when provided by the
         AIS unit, should immediately follow the related `ACA` sentence,
         containing the same sequence number. The AIS unit generating the `ACA`
         and `ACS` sentences, should increment the sequence number each time an
         `ACA`/`ACS` pair is created. After 9 is used the process should begin
         again from 0. Information contained in the `ACS` sentence is not related
         to the information of the `ACA` sentence if the sequence numbers are
         different. When an external device is sending an `ACA` sentence to the
         AIS unit, the sequence number may be `nil` if no `ACS` sentence is being
         sent.

         external application with the means to initiate requests for specific
         ITU-R M.1371 messages, from distant mobile or base station, AIS units. A
         single sentence can be used to request up to two messages from one AIS unit
         and one message from a second AIS unit, or up to three messages from one
         AIS unit. The message types that can be requested are limited. The complete
         list of messages that may be requested can be found within the Message 15
         description in ITU-R M.1371. Improper requests may be ignored. With Message
         10 always Message 11 is requested.

         The external application initiates the interrogation. The external
         application is responsible for assessing the success or failure of the
         interrogation. After receiving this sentence, the AIS unit initiates a
         radio broadcast (on the VHF Data Link) of a Message 10 or 15 –
         interrogation. The success or failure of the interrogation broadcast is
         determined by the application using the combined reception of the
         `ABK`-sentence and `VDM` sentences provided by the AIS unit. After
         receiving this `AIR`-sentence, the AIS unit shall take no more than four
         seconds to broadcast the Message 10 or 15, and the addressed distant
         unit(s) shall take no more than another four seconds to respond – a total
         of eight seconds.

         only one station. The fields of station 2 should be `nil` fields in this
         case.

         8.3.13 BBM – AIS broadcast binary message

         This sentence supports generation of ITU-R M.1371 binary Messages 8 and 14.
         This provides the application with a means to broadcast data, as defined by
         the application only. Data is defined by the application only – not the
         AIS. This message offers great flexibility for implementing system
         functions that use the AIS unit as a digital broadcast device. After
         receiving this sentence, via the IEC 61162-2 interface, the AIS unit
         initiates a VHF broadcast of either Message 8 or 14 within 4 s. (See the
         `ABK` sentence for acknowledgement of the `BBM`.)

         - Parameter sequentialIdentifier: Sequential message identifier, 0 to 9.
         The sequential message identifier provides a message identification
         number from 0 to 9 that is sequentially assigned and is incremented for
         each new multi-sentence message. The count resets to 0 after 9 is used.
         For a message requiring multiple sentences, each sentence of the message
         contains the same sequential message identification number. It is used to
         identify the sentences containing portions of the same message. This
         allows for the possibility that other sentences might be interleaved with
         the message sentences that, taken collectively, contain a single message.
         This value is used by the `ABK` sentence to acknowledge a specific `BBM`
         sentence.
         - Parameter channel: The AIS channel that should be used for the broadcast.
         - Parameter messageID: ITU-R M.1371 Message ID (``AIS/MessageID/broadcastBinary`` or ``AIS/MessageID/broadcastSafety``).
         - Parameter data: This is the content of the “binary data” parameter for
         ITU-R M.1371 Message 8, or the “Safety related text” parameter for
         Message 14.

         the RAIM in the GNSS receiver, the receiver can isolate faults to
         individual satellites and not use them in its position and velocity
         calculations. Also, the GNSS receiver can still track the satellite and
         easily judge when it is back within tolerance. This sentence shall be used
         for reporting this RAIM information. To perform this integrity function,
         the GNSS receiver should have at least two observables in addition to the
         minimum required for navigation. Normally these observables take the form
         of additional redundant satellites.

         This sentence provides a means of transmitting generic binary information

         the bandwidth. In general, the proper decoding and interpretation of binary

         this standard. This standard contains information that describes how the
         data should be coded, decoded, and structured. The specific meaning of the
         binary data is obtained outwith this standard.

         Data too large for a single sentence is represented by consecutive `GEN`
         sentences, where `index` increments by the number of groups in the previous
         sentence. For example, 20 bytes of generic data (encoded in 10 groups)

         “Age of differential data” and “Differential reference station ID” data
         should be provided in following `GNS` sentences with talker IDs of
         ``Talker/GPS``, ``Talker/GLONASS``, etc. These following `GNS` messages
         should have the `position`, `geoidalSeparation`, `mode`, and `HDOP` fields
         be `nil`. This indicates to the listener that the field is supporting a
         previous `GNS` sentence with the same time tag. The `numSatellites` field
         may be used in these following sentences to denote the number of satellites
         used from that satellite system.

         ## Age of Differential Data

         For GPS Differential Data: This value is the average age of the most recent
         differential corrections in use. When only RTCM SC104 Type 1 corrections
         are used, the age is that of the most recent Type 1 correction. When
         RTCM SC104 Type 9 corrections are used solely, or in combination with
         Type 1 corrections, the age is the average of the most recent corrections
         for the satellites used. `nil` when Differential GPS is not used.

         For GLONASS Differential Data: This value is the average age of the most
         recent differential corrections in use. When only RTCM SC104 Type 31
         corrections are used, the age is that of the most recent Type 31
         correction. When RTCM SC104 Type 34 corrections are used solely, or in
         combination with Type 31 corrections, the age is the average of the most
         recent corrections for the satellites used. `nil` when differential GLONASS
         is not used.

         For Galileo Differential Data: This value is the average age of the most
         recent differential corrections in use. When only RTCM SC104 Type 41
         corrections are used, the age is that of the most recent Type 41
         correction. When RTCM SC104 Type 42 corrections are used solely, or in
         combination with Type 41 corrections, the age is the average of the most
         recent corrections for the satellites used. `nil` when differential Galileo
         is not used.

         8.3.38 GRS – GNSS range residuals

         This sentence is used to support Receiver Autonomous Integrity Monitoring
         (RAIM). Range residuals can be computed in two ways for this process. The
         basic measurement integration cycle of most navigation filters generates a
         set of residuals and uses these to update the position state of the
         receiver. These residuals can be reported with `GRS`, but because of the
         fact that these were used to generate the navigation solution they should
         be recomputed using the new solution in order to reflect the residuals for
         the position solution in the `GGA` or `GNS` sentence. The `recomputed
         field should indicate which computation method was used. An integrity
         process that uses these range residuals would also require `GGA` or `GNS`,
         the `GSA`, and the `GSV` sentences to be sent.

         If only GPS, GLONASS, Galileo etc. is used for the reported position
         solution the talker ID is ``Talker/GPS``, ``Talker/GLONASS``,
         ``Talker/galileo``, etc. and the range residuals pertain to the individual
         system. If GPS, GLONASS, Galileo, etc. are combined to obtain the position
         solution multiple `GRS` sentences are produced, one with the GPS
         satellites, another with the GLONASS satellites, another with Galileo
         satellites, etc. each of these `GRS` sentences shall have talker ID
         ``Talker/GNSS``, to indicate that the satellites are used in a combined
         solution. It is important to distinguish the residuals from those that
         would be produced by a GPS-only, GLONASS-only, Galileo-only, etc. position
         solution. In general the residuals for a combined solution will be
         different from the residual for a GPS-only, GLONASS-only, Galileo-only,
         etc. solution.

         - Parameter residuals: Range residuals for satellites used in the
         navigation. If the range residual exceeds ±99,9 m, then the decimal part
         is dropped, resulting in an integer (–103,7 becomes –103). The maximum
         value for this field is ±999.
         - Parameter time: UTC time of the `GGA` or `GNS` fix associated with this
         sentence
         - Parameter recomputed: If `false`, residuals were used to calculate the
         position given in the matching `GGA` or `GNS` sentence. If `true`,
         residuals were re-computed after the `GGA` or `GNS` position was computed.

         - Parameter override: Override provides direct control of the steering
         gear. In the context of this sentence, override means a temporary
         interruption of the selected steering mode. In this period, steering
         is performed by special devices. As long as this field is `true`,
         both fields `mode` and `turnMode` should be ignored by the

         8.3.54 LRI – AIS long-range interrogation,
         8.3.53 LRF – AIS long-range function

         The long-range interrogation of the AIS unit is accomplished through
         the use of two sentences. The pair of interrogation sentence
         formatters, a `LRI` sentence followed by a `LRF` sentence, provides the
         information needed by a universal AIS unit to determine if it should
         construct and provide the reply sentences (`LRF`, `LR1`, `LR2`, and
         `LR3`). The `LRI` sentence contains the information that the AIS unit
         needs in order to determine if the reply sentences need to be
         constructed. The `LRF` sentence identifies the information that needs
         to be in those reply sentences.

         The `LRF` sentence is used in both long-range interrogation requests
         and long-range interrogation replies. The `LRF`-sentence is the second
         sentence of the long-range interrogation request pair, `LRI` and `LRF`
         (see the `LRI`-sentence).

         - Parameter replyLogic: Control flag. The control flag affects AIS
         unit’s reply logic.

         `LR3`-sentence follow the `LR1`-sentence if information provided in
         these sentences was requested by the interrogation. Fields not included
         in the interrogation reply are `nil`.

         The `LR1` sentence identifies the destination for the reply and
         contains the information items requested by the
         ``AISLongRange/Function/shipID`` function (see the `LRF` sentence).

         The `LR2`-sentence contains the information items requested by the
         ``AISLongRange/Function/dateTime``, ``AISLongRange/Function/position``,
         ``AISLongRange/Function/course``, and ``AISLongRange/Function/speed``

         8.3.55 MEB – Message input for broadcast command

         This sentence is used to input a message for storage or immediate
         broadcast. The sentence associates messages with real, virtual, and
         synthetic MMSIs.

         The stored message is associated by the MMSI, Message ID, and Message
         ID Index. The combination of MMSI, Message ID, and Message ID Index are
         used to reference the stored message and link the message to a
         transmission schedule as defined by a `CBR` sentence. The stored
         message’s broadcast begins when both the message content and schedule
         have been entered.

         For immediate message broadcast, the binary data will be broadcast
         using the slots reserved by the `CBR` sentence with both Message ID and
         Message ID Index = 0, or will be broadcast within 4 s according to
         RATDMA rules. The channel for the immediate message broadcast is
         specified by `AISChannel`.

         This sentence can be queried. When queried, the query response may
         contain one or more sentences and will continue until the transfer of
         all stored information is complete.

         - Parameter sequence: Sequential message identifier. This sequential
         message identifier serves two purposes. It meets the requirements as
         stated in 7.3.4 and it is the sequence number utilized by
         ITU-R M.1371 in message types ``AIS/MessageID/addressedBinary`` and
         ``AIS/MessageID/addressedSafety``. The range of this field is
         restricted by ITU-R M1371 to 0 to 3. The sequential message identifier
         value may be reused after the AIS unit provides the `ABK`
         acknowledgement for this number. See
         ``AISBroadcastAcknowledgement(MMSI:channel:messageID:sequence:type:)``.
         - Parameter AISChannel: AIS channel for broadcast of the radio message.
         For an immediate message broadcast, this cannot be `nil`. For a
         stored message it should be `nil`.
         - Parameter MMSI: For the message to be broadcast, this MMSI should
         match a previously entered real, virtual, or synthetic MMSI.
         - Parameter messageID: ITU-R M.1371 Message ID. ITU-R M.1371 messages
         supported by this sentence: 6, 8, 12, 14, 25, and 26. See IEC 62320-2
         for the ITU-R M.1371 messages that are supported by an AIS AtoN station.
         - Parameter messageIndex: Message ID Index
         - Parameter broadcastBehavior: Broadcast behaviour
         - Parameter destinationMMSI: Destination MMSI, for addressed messages
         - Parameter binaryStructure: Binary data flag
         - Parameter sentenceType: Sentence status flag
         - Parameter data: Encapsulated data. This is the content of the “binary
         data” parameter for either ITU-R M.1371 Message 6, 8, 25, or 26, or
         the “safety related text” parameter for either Message 12 or 14.

         occur, the sequential message identifier can be relied upon to
         uniquely identify this NAVTEX message from other NAVTEX messages with
         the same message code.
         - Parameter frequency: The frequency indicator identifies the frequency
         that the NAVTEX message was received on.
         - Parameter code: The NAVTEX message code contains three related
         entities. The first character identifies the transmitter coverage
         area and the second character identifies the type of message. Both
         these characters are as defined in Table I of Recommendation ITU-R
         M.625-3, combination numbers 1 to 26. Transmitter identification
         characters are allocated by the IMO NAVTEX Co-ordinating Panel; these
         characters and the meanings of the message type characters are
         described in the NAVTEX manual (IMO publication 951E). The remaining
         two characters are restricted to numerals with a range of 00 to 99
         and represent a serial number for each type of message. The value of
         00 is a special case and not considered a serial number. See
         IEC 61097-6 for interpretation of special case value of 00.
         - Parameter time: UTC of receipt of message
         - Parameter totalCharacters: Total number of characters in this series
         of `NRX` sentences
         - Parameter badCharacters: Total number of bad characters
         - Parameter isValid: `true` is used for syntactically correct message
         reception. `false` is used for syntactically incorrect message
         reception, for example end characters NNNN missing.

         8.3.86 TUT – Transmission of multi-language text

         A sentence to support multi-language text using a variable length Hex
         field in the sentence definition.

         The sentence structure is similar to the `TXT` sentence, however, it
         has two additional fields. There is a “source identifier” field used to
         identify the origin of the sentence and a “translation code” field that
         is used to define the coding system for the text body. This enables the
         use of multi-language codes, such as, unicode or other codes. A
         proprietary look-up table method is incorporated to allow pre-defined
         messages to be sent in short sentences.

         If `translationCode` is `U` (Unicode, ISO 10646-1), `A` (ASCII), or `1`
         through `16` (ISO 8859-1 through -16), then `text` will contain the
         decoded string. If `translationCode` is `Pxxx` (proprietary), `text`
         will be `nil` and `data` will contain the undecoded string.

         - Parameter source: Source identifier
         - Parameter text: Text body, if `data` is encoded in a
         non-proprietary format. `nil` if `data` is encoded in a proprietary
         format.
         - Parameter data: The undecoded data. For Unicode, each unicode
         character is represented by 4 Hex character codes. The letter “A” would
         be represented by 0041 hex, while the “Katakana letter A” would be
         represented by 30A2 hex. For ASCII, each ASCII character is represented
         by 2 Hex character codes. The letter “A” would be represented by 41
         hex, while the Latin capital letter thorn “Þ” would be represented by
         DE hex. The “Katakana letter A” cannot be represented by 2 Hex
         character codes.
         - Parameter translationCode: Translation code for text body.
         `U` = Unicode, `A` = ASCII, `1` through `16` = subset and part number
         of ISO 8859, `Pxyz` = Proprietary (user defined).
