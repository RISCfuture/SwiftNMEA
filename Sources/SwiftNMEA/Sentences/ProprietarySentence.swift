/// 7.3.6 Proprietary sentences
///
/// These are sentences not included within this standard; these provide a means

/// transfer data which does not fall within the scope of approved sentences. This
/// will generally be for one of the following reasons:
///
/// * data is intended for another device from the same manufacturer, is device
///   specific, and not in a form or of a type of interest to the general user;
/// * data is being used for test purposes prior to the adoption of approved
///   sentences;
/// * data is not of a type and general usefulness which merits the creation of an
///   approved sentence.
///
/// Details of proprietary data fields are not included in this standard and need
/// not be submitted for approval. However, it is required that such sentences be
/// published in the manufacturerâ€™s manuals for reference.
